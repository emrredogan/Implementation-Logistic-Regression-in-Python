Trying to implement logistic regression without using scikit-learn

In the DataPreprocessing class, you will find:

i) Basic descriptive statistics methods	                                                                                                                   
ii) Label encoding method                                                                                                                                   
iii)Correlation elimination to prevent multicollinearity.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                           
In the LogisticRegression class, you will find:                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                           
i) The sigmoid function                                                                                                                                     
ii) The fit function                                                                                                                                       
iii) The predict function                                                                                                                                   
iv) A function to calculate accuracy.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                           
In the main file, all functions are applied to the dataset. You can view the details by examining the files.
